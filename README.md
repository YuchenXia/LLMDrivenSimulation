### Research Paper 
- **Framework Introduction**: Introduces a framework integrating a multi-agent system with large language models (LLMs) to interact with a simulation model for conducting experiments.
- **Project Status**: Currently a **work-in-progress** research project and the paper is **under peer-review**.
- **Focus Area**: we are continuing to investigate more sophisticated simulation models for **industrial automation systems**.
